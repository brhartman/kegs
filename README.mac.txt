MAC OS X port of KEGS (KEGSMAC): http://kegs.sourceforge.net
-------------------------------------------------------------

This is a Mac OS X Swift port.

Usage:
-----

Like most other KEGS versions, KEGSMAC is best run from a Terminal
window.  Just type "./KEGSMAC.app/Contents/MacOS/KEGSMAC" in the directory
you installed/compiled it in.  You need to have a ROM file (named
ROM, ROM.01, or ROM.03) and a config.kegs in the same directory or in your
home directory (read the README--these files are searched for in various
places).

KEGSMAC can also be run from the Finder, but if you do this, debugging
problems is a little tougher.

To quit, either click the window close box, or select Quit from the menu.
To go full screen, click the Maximize button in the window.  You can
resize the window to any size you like.
