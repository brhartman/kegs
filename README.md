# KEGS - Kent's Emulated GS
## An Apple IIgs emulator for Mac OS X, Linux/Unix, and Windows

This is a fork of the official version of [KEGS](http://kegs.sourceforge.net/).

There are a couple of changes:

- Addition of x10 and x100 speeds to allow very fast emulation without using 100% processor like unlimited does
- Fix for pulse audio skipping on Linux - *this has been merged into the official release as of KEGS v1.14*

Please note that the binaries contained in main are unchanged from the upstream source and so do *not* contain the above changes.
