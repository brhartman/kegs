# KEGS - Kent's Emulated GS
## An Apple IIgs emulator for Mac OS X, Linux, and Unix/X11

This is a fork of the official version [KEGS](http://kegs.sourceforge.net/).

There are a couple of changes:

- Addition of x10 and x100 speeds to allow very fast emulation without using 100% processor like unlimited does
- Fix for pulse audio skipping on Linux - *this has been merged into the official release as of KEGS v1.14*
